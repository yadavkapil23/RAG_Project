# 🚀 RAG System with LangChain and FastAPI 🌐

Welcome to this repository! This project demonstrates how to build a powerful RAG system using **LangChain** and **FastAPI** for generating contextually relevant and accurate responses by integrating external data into the generative process.

## 📋 Project Overview

The RAG system combines retrieval and generation to provide smarter AI-driven responses. Using **LangChain** for document handling and embeddings, and **FastAPI** for deploying a fast, scalable API, this project includes:

- 🗂️ **Document Loading**: Load data from various sources (text, PDFs, etc.).
- ✂️ **Text Splitting**: Break large documents into manageable chunks.
- 🧠 **Embeddings**: Generate vector embeddings for efficient search and retrieval.
- 🔍 **Vector Stores**: Store embeddings in a vector store for fast similarity searches.
- 🔧 **Retrieval**: Retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- 💬 **Generative Response**: Use retrieved data with language models (LLMs) to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
- 🌐 **FastAPI**: Deploy the RAG system as a scalable API for easy interaction.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 🐳 Docker (optional, for deployment)
- 🛠️ PostgreSQL or FAISS (for vector storage)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yadavkapil23/RAG_Project.git
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   Now, your FastAPI app will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` 🎉!

### Add Your OpenAI API Key 🔑

To integrate the OpenAI language model into your RAG system, you’ll need to provide your OpenAI API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Get your API key: If you don’t have one yet, you can generate your OpenAI API key by logging into your account on the OpenAI platform.

2. Create a .env file: In the root directory of your project, create a .env file to securely store your API key. The .env file allows you to load environment variables.

3. Add the API key to the .env file: Open the .env file and add the following line, replacing your-openai-api-key with your actual OpenAI key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

4. Load the API key in your code: Ensure your application loads this key when it runs. In your Python code, you can use the python-dotenv package to automatically load environment variables from the .env file:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Then, wherever you're initializing the OpenAI API, add:

```
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
Now, your OpenAI API key is securely loaded from the environment, and you're ready to start using it in your RAG system! 🎉

## 🛠️ Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines the best of both worlds—retrieving relevant data and generating insightful responses.
- **Scalable API**: FastAPI makes it easy to deploy and scale the RAG system.
- **Document Handling**: Supports multiple document types for loading and processing.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Efficient search with FAISS or other vector stores.

## 🛡️ Security

- 🔐 **OAuth2 and API Key** authentication support for secure API access.
- 🔒 **TLS/SSL** for encrypting data in transit.
- 🛡️ **Data encryption** for sensitive document storage.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker Deployment
If you want to deploy your RAG system using Docker, simply build the Docker image and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t rag-system .
docker run -p 8000:8000 rag-system
```

### Cloud Deployment
Deploy your RAG system to the cloud using platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud** with minimal setup.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- 🔄 **Real-time Data Integration**: Add real-time data sources for dynamic responses.
- 🤖 **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Implement deep learning-based retrievers for better query understanding.
- 📊 **Monitoring Tools**: Add monitoring with tools like Prometheus or Grafana for performance insights.
